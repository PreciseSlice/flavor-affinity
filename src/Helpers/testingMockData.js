They also purchased a distillery in Schiedam, the former center of the Dutch gin manufactory.\r\nAround 1920 they began with the production of liqueurs. In the thirties, De Kuyper produced nearly twenty species of liqueurs, including apricot brandy, cherry brandy, triple sec and crème de menthe. The collective name for those liqueurs since 1920 is, \u0091Range Likeuren\u0092. This refers to liqueurs flavoured with fruit, spices or liquorice.\r\nThey also worked on renewing the Dutch gin range. \r\nOn the occasion of the 300th anniversary the company was awarded with the title Koninklijke (Royal), and changed the name Joh\u0092s de Kuyper & Zoon BV permanently into Koninklijke De Kuyper.\r\nIn 2009, they acquired Mandarine Napoleon.',
